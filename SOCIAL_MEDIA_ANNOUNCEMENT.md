## Dev.to Article Title & Introduction

Title: **Introducing @vormir-tech/react: A Modern, Accessible React UI Library**

---

Hi developers! 👋

I'm excited to share the first release of **@vormir-tech/react** - a React UI component library I've been building with a focus on accessibility, developer experience, and modern design.

## Why Another UI Library?

Great question! While there are excellent UI libraries out there, I wanted to create something that:

1. **Puts Accessibility First** - Not as an afterthought, but baked into every component
2. **Offers Beautiful Themes** - 5 pre-built themes with extensive customization
3. **Provides Complete TypeScript Support** - Not just types, but excellent IntelliSense
4. **Stays Modern** - Built with React 18+, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI primitives
5. **Remains Flexible** - Headless UI approach with styled defaults

## What's Included? (v0.1.0)

### 47 Production-Ready Components
